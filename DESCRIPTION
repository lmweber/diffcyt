Title: Differential discovery in high-dimensional cytometry via high-resolution clustering
Description: Statistical methods for differential discovery analyses in high-dimensional cytometry data (including flow cytometry, mass cytometry or CyTOF, and oligonucleotide-tagged cytometry), based on a combination of high-resolution clustering and empirical Bayes moderated tests adapted from transcriptomics.
